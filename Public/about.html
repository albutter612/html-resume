       <hr />
       <p>I am Alex Butterbrodt. Designer, endurance athlete, backcountry skier, and mountain biker. My appetite for the outdoors started in Tucson, Arizona, and grew in college when I began rock climbing and endurance racing. It got even stronger when I moved to Colorado and picked up mountain biking and backcountry skiing. I am a motivated and determined individual, not just in leading an active lifestyle, but in my career as well.</p>
       <p>I have always strived to combine my passion for the outdoors with my technical skills in design. I currently hold a position as the Senior Graphic Designer at PeopleForBikes, and completed a contract as a UX Designer at Hanai Health, a technology provider enabling education and healthcare access. Through each position, I have grown professionally and personally. Developing brand guidelines, executing on campaigns, and managing other designers, to navigating backcountry ski trips and being a mountain bike mentor.</p>
